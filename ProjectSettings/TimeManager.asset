TimeManager:                   # This object configures Unity's global time settings.
  m_ObjectHideFlags: 0         # Hide flags for the object; 0 means no special hiding.
  Fixed Timestep: 0.02         # The interval (in seconds) at which physics updates (FixedUpdate) occur.
  Maximum Allowed Timestep: 0.33333334  # Caps the timestep when the frame rate is low, preventing excessively long physics steps.
  m_TimeScale: 1               # Global time scale; 1 represents normal speed, <1 for slow-motion, and >1 for fast-motion.
  Maximum Particle Timestep: 0.03   # Caps the timestep for particle simulation, improving accuracy at lower frame rates.
